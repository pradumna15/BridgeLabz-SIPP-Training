# BridgeLabz-SIPP-Training

This repository hosts a structured collection of Java training modules developed under the BridgeLabz SIPP Program. The content is organized across four dedicated branches, each focusing on a key pillar of Java development.

ðŸ“Œ Branch Structure

ðŸ”¹ 1. Core-Java â€“ Foundations of Java Programming
This branch lays the groundwork for your Java journey. It introduces fundamental concepts and syntax to build a solid understanding of the language.

Topics Covered:

Java Syntax & Program Structure

Data Types & Variables

Operators & Expressions

Conditional Logic (if, else, switch)

Looping Constructs (for, while, do-while)

Arrays & String Manipulation

Exception Handling

Basic I/O (Scanner, BufferedReader)

Introduction to Methods & Functions

ðŸ”¹ 2. OOPs â€“ Object-Oriented Programming in Java
This branch focuses on Java's object-oriented principles that form the core of real-world software development.

Topics Covered:

Classes & Objects

Constructors & Constructor Overloading

Inheritance & Use of super

Polymorphism (Compile-time & Runtime)

Abstraction (Abstract Classes & Interfaces)

Encapsulation & Access Control

Static vs Instance Context

Usage of this and super

Methods from Object Class (toString(), equals() etc.)

ðŸ”¹ 3. DSA â€“ Data Structures and Algorithms in Java
Designed to sharpen your problem-solving skills, this branch teaches efficient algorithmic techniques often tested in technical interviews.

Topics Covered:

Arrays & ArrayLists

String Handling & StringBuilder

Stack & Queue Implementations

Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

Searching (Linear & Binary)

Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort)

Recursion Techniques

Hashing (HashMap, HashSet)

Time & Space Complexity Analysis (Big-O Notation)

ðŸ”¹ 4. Generics&Packages â€“ Advanced Java Concepts
This branch introduces Java Generics and Package management to help build reusable, modular, and type-safe code.

Topics Covered:

Generic Classes & Methods

Bounded Type Parameters

Wildcards (? extends T, ? super T)

Generic Constructors

Type Erasure in Java

Java Packages & Access Modifiers

Creating and Importing Custom Packages

Composition vs Inheritance

Real-World Applications of Generics
